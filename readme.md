## Data Domain
We were highly interested in geographic data and elements of the US Census. Using a map is an intuitive way to filter multidimensional data when applicable. Furthermore, it is an ideal medium for encouraging civic awareness as people can relate abstract data to physical areas that they are familiar with. We combined geojson and topojson files from J. Goodall's [US Maps Repo](https://github.com/jgoodall/us-maps) with data from the [2013 US Census American Community Survey on Educational Attainment](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_S1501&src=pt).


## Storyboard
  1. Map of Washington with county outlines displayed. County tiles are clickable.
  2. When a county is selected, the user is presented with data on county population, educational attainments, and median income levels by education category. These statistics can be viewed in aggregate, or split by gender.
  3. When the user selects a second county, she can see a comparison between the two counties.
